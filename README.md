There are two Jupyter's notebooks. First of them is about the function approximation and second one is about similarity of the texts. The sentences for analysis are contained in $sentences.txt$. The result of the first code is saved in $function$ $approximation.txt$ and these are coefficients $w_0, w_1, w_2, w_3$ in our approximation $f(x) = w_0 + w_1x + w_2x^2 + w_3x^3$ for starting array $x = [1, 4, 10, 15]$ and function $f(x) = sin(x / 5) * exp(x / 10) + 5 * exp(-x / 2)$ on the segment from 1 to 15. The result of the second code is saved in $similarity$ $of$ $texts.txt$ and these are numbers of the two most similar sentences in the file. Similarity is calculated using the cosine distance.
